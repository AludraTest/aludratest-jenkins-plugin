  To use the AludraTest Report Generator, you must configure your AludraTest based project to generate Log4Testing
  output using the <code>org.aludratest.log4testing.xml.XmlTestLogWriter</code> writer. Use the <code>log4testing.xml</code>
  file to configure this. Here, enter the path to the generated XML log file, relative to the workspace.
